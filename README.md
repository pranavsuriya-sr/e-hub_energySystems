# ‚ö° Energy Systems Analysis & Visualization

A comprehensive Python-based web application developed using Streamlit, this project provides tools for analysis and visualization in energy systems. The website includes modules for power and impedance triangle plotting, circuit solving, phase diagram visualization, and more, making it a valuable resource for students and professionals in energy systems.

## üìú Abstract

This project presents a web application with four distinct solvers to analyze and visualize energy systems:
- **Power and Impedance Triangle Plotter**: Visualizes key parameters in AC circuits through power and impedance triangles.
- **Circuit Solver and Visualizer**: Allows analysis and computation of electrical circuits with various components.
- **Phasor Diagram Plotter**: Provides visualizations of phase diagrams for short transmission lines.
  
The user-friendly interface of Streamlit enhances accessibility, making these analytical tools practical and efficient.

## üåü Features

1. **Power and Impedance Triangle Plotter**:
   - Users input voltage, current, and phase angle values to visualize power and impedance triangles.
   - Functions:
     - `calculate_power_triangle`: Calculates real, reactive, and apparent power.
     - `calculate_imped_triangle`: Calculates impedance triangle components.
     - `plot_power_triangle` and `plot_imped_triangle`: Display power and impedance triangles.

2. **Circuit Solver and Visualizer**:
   - Enables users to design circuits with resistors, capacitors, and inductors, and visualize total impedance and current.
   - Functions:
     - `draw_circuit`: Uses schemdraw to create circuit diagrams.
     - `calculate_imped`: Calculates impedance based on component types and values.

3. **Phasor Diagram Plotter for Short Transmission Lines**:
   - Users can input transmission line parameters to visualize phasors for sending and receiving voltage, line and load currents.
   - Ideal for understanding short transmission line behavior and optimizing configurations.
